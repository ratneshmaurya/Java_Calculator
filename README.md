<h1> This project aims to obtain basic skills in Java and OOPs principles by building a subset of features seen in calculators. </h1>

<h2> During the course of this project: </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Made use of different features of VSCode IDE to build the project.</li>
  <li>Built feature of a calculator by following OOPS Principles.</li>
  <li>Wrote unit tests to ensure edge cases are handled correctly.</li>
  <li>Fixed the bugs in the implementation of newly introduced features of the calculator.</li>
</ul>

Project structure -
The above 2 folders ApplyOops and DebugAndHandleException, contains the code for Standard calculator, in ApplyOops we have performed the bsic encapsulation and abstraction, while in the DebugAndHandleException we have handled the exceptions.

I have written again the Standard calculator class in 3rd and 4th folder becoz there are some little changes like access specifier changing of result variable and some other features.

The 3rd folder ScientificCalculator contains the code for scientific calculator that is inheriting the functions of Standard calculator Class.

The 4th folder contains the contains the code for New Logic calculator that is also inheriting the functions of Standard calculator Class. This new calculator is made just for practice purpose.
